# web-audio-recorder

An express based web app that allows for scheduled recording of audio sources. This app features a client interface to manage the recording schedulle. Recorded audio clips may optionally be stored in S3 object storage and accessed from the client interface.

## Use cases

The primary goal of this project was to develop a node webapp to be deployed to a server that would automatically record http radio streams for archival purposes. However, this app would also be useful for: 
* Recording scheduled web radio shows to listen to them later. 
* Having a reliable method to automatically record radio stations for brand management purposes, like ensuring advertisements ran during those shows.
* Scheduled recordings of a streaming home media server.
